        <H2>About Me</H2>

        <img id="bio-image" src="assets/images/me.png" alt="Nikki Bellock">

        <p>MBA and PMP Graduate with 12+ years IT project management experience. I have extensive 
           experience coordinating major continuous improvement initiatives with sustainable results.
           I specialize in multi-phase enterprise system implementation with a focus in deployment
           readiness, issue management and post launch support with the ability to understand and 
           work through issues from the end customer perspective.
        </p>
        
        <p>I have 2 dogs, 2 cats, and 2 horses. I have a menagerie of black and white animals. Crazy cat lady if you will.
            I'm deathly allergic to all animals with fur; however, I take a handful of pills in the morning so I can survive
            the day filled with shedding fur and doggy kisses.
        </p>

        <p>
            I like long walks on the hot sidewalk next to busy streets. I just love to hear the roaring of 
            the cars and the wind in my hair as they pass by at mach 1 </p>
        <p> Fun fact: I went on over 100 dates in 1.5 years. I was, as you'd say, a serial dater. It was fun and I 
            ate a lot of sushi.
